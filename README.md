# pqcore-heatmaps
In this project we provide an exemplary analysis of [pq-cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11776) with [conexp-clj](https://github.com/tomhanika/conexp-clj). We compute the core lattice sizes of the living beings and water context and a pq-core. A more detailed analysis of such diagrams can be found in the paper.
